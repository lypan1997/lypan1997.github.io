### Conferences

1. Oral Presentation: “Subspace signal detection using distributed MIMO radar in structured interference and Gaussian disturbance”, in IEEE 2019 International Conference on Control, Automation and Information Sciences (ICCAIS), 2019. Introduced the proposed subspace detectors designed to suppress interference and noise and illustrated the performance improvements of the proposed detectors, especially for the proposed persymmetric one in the training-limited scenarios.

2. Oral Presentation: “Persymmetric Subspace Rao and Wald Tests for Distributed Target in Partially Homogeneous Environment”, in IEEE 11th Sensor Array and Multichannel Signal Processing Workshop (SAM), 2020. Introduced the proposed persymmetric subspace Rao detector and the persymmetric subspace Wald detector, and illustrated the superiority of the proposed detectors in training-restricted situations.

### Research Experience

1. Jamming suppression performance evaluation

Evaluated the jamming suppression performance by exploiting the orthogonal design, uniform design and Bayesian-Regularization neural network.

2. Clutter suppression through distribution classification

A classifier was built based on residual network (ResNet) to categorize the clutter distribution automatically, so that the clutter could be suppressed in a targeted way.

3. Applications of Natural Language Processing exploiting deep learning approaches

Addressed social network problems, such as spam email detection, and sentiment classification for Twitter comment texts, based on deep learning framework Pytorch.
