### Conferences

1. Oral Presentation: “Subspace signal detection using distributed MIMO radar in structured interference and Gaussian disturbance”, in IEEE 2019 International Conference on Control, Automation and Information Sciences (ICCAIS), 2019. Introduced the proposed subspace detectors designed to suppress interference and noise and illustrated the performance improvements of the proposed detectors, especially for the proposed persymmetric one in the training-limited scenarios.

2. Oral Presentation: “Persymmetric Subspace Rao and Wald Tests for Distributed Target in Partially Homogeneous Environment”, in IEEE 11th Sensor Array and Multichannel Signal Processing Workshop (SAM), 2020. Introduced the proposed persymmetric subspace Rao detector and the persymmetric subspace Wald detector, and illustrated the superiority of the proposed detectors in training-restricted situations.
